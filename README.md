# cfc_err_forwarder
A pure-lua (well, Moonscript) Error tracker for Garry's Mod.

This addon will watch for errors, do a little investigation, and send a message to a Discord channel for your review.

## Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è
A full-rewrite of this addon is nearly complete. It has fixes, new features, and design reworks.

Please keep an eye out for the update!

You can track its progress in our support Discord: https://discord.gg/5JUqZjzmYJ

### Some nifty features:
 - üß† If using source-controlled addons (i.e. git repos in your `addons/` dir), err_forwarder will generate a link to github.com, showing you the exact line that errored
 - ü™ù Tracks Serverside and (optionally) Clientside errors, and can send messages to different channels depending on which realm the errors occurred in
 - üì¶ Includes basic batching logic so it won't spam your error channel
 - üîé Shows you the current values of up to 8 local variables in the stack that threw an error (very useful for debugging!)

## Requirements
 - [gm_logger](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/gm_logger) _(Optional)_

## Installation
**Simple**

**Source Controlled**
 - You can clone this repository directly into your `addons` directory, but be sure to check out the [`lua`](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/cfc_err_forwarder/tree/lua) branch which contains the compiled Lua from the latest release.
 - e.g. ``` git clone --single-branch --branch lua git@github.com:CFC-Servers/cfc_err_forwarder.git ```


## Configuration
 - **`cfc_err_forwarder_interval`**: The interval (in seconds) at which errors are parsed and sent to Discord
 - **`cfc_err_forwarder_server_webhook`**: The full Discord Webhook URL to send Serverside errors
 - **`cfc_err_forwarder_client_webhook`**: The full Discord Webhook URL to send Clientside errors
 - **`cfc_err_forwarder_client_enabled`**: A boolean indicating whether or not the addon should even track Clientside errors
