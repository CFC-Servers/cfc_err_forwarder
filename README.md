# cfc_err_forwarder
A pure-lua (well, Moonscript) Error tracker for Garry's Mod.

This addon will watch for errors, do a little investigation, and send a message to a Discord channel for your review.

<br>

## Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è
A full-rewrite of this addon is nearly complete. It has fixes, new features, design reworks, and will attempt to use the upcoming [`OnLuaError`](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:OnLuaError) hook.

Please keep an eye out for the update!

You can track its progress in our support Discord: https://discord.gg/5JUqZjzmYJ

### Some nifty features:
 - üß† If using source-controlled addons (i.e. git repos in your `addons/` dir), err_forwarder will generate a link to github.com, showing you the exact line that errored
 - ü™ù Tracks Serverside and (optionally) Clientside errors, and can send messages to different channels depending on which realm the errors occurred in
 - üì¶ Includes basic batching logic so it won't spam your error channel
 - üîé Shows you the current values of up to 8 local variables in the stack that threw an error (very useful for debugging!)

## Requirements
 - [gm_logger](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/gm_logger) _(Optional)_
 - [gm_luaerror](https://github.com/danielga/gm_luaerror)
 - [gmsv_reqwest](https://github.com/WilliamVenner/gmsv_reqwest)


## Installation
**Simple**
 - You can download the latest release .zip from the [Releases](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/cfc_err_forwarder/releases) tab. Extract that and place it in your `addons` directory.

**Source Controlled**
 - You can clone this repository directly into your `addons` directory, but be sure to check out the [`lua`](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/cfc_err_forwarder/tree/lua) branch which contains the compiled Lua from the latest release.
 - e.g. ``` git clone --single-branch --branch lua git@github.com:CFC-Servers/cfc_err_forwarder.git ```


## Configuration
 - **`cfc_err_forwarder_interval`**: The interval (in seconds) at which errors are parsed and sent to Discord
 - **`cfc_err_forwarder_server_webhook`**: The full Discord Webhook URL to send Serverside errors
 - **`cfc_err_forwarder_client_webhook`**: The full Discord Webhook URL to send Clientside errors
 - **`cfc_err_forwarder_client_enabled`**: A boolean indicating whether or not the addon should even track Clientside errors

## Hooks

### `CFC_ErrorForwarder_PreQueue`
Called before an Error is queued to be processed. 

Return `false` to prevent it from being queued.

You may also _(carefully)_ modify the error structure.

### Error Structure
With the following code:
```lua
-- addons/example/lua/example/init.lua
AddCSLuaFile()
if SERVER then return end

local function exampleFunction()
    print( 5 + {} )
end

hook.Add( "InitPostEntity", "Example", function()
    ProtectedCall( exampleFunction )
end )
```

The error structure would look like:
| **Name**         | **Type**  | **Example**                                                          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                         |
